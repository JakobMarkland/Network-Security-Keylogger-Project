# B439 Keylogger Project

In this project we we're to propose an idea for a project that involves Network Security. I proposed the idea of making a Keylogger. A Keylogger is a program that once executed, the program will run forever because it uses an intentional infinite loop. Every 10ms the program updates. Everytime a user that is running the program presses a key on their keyboard, it is logged into a text file. This can be used to obtain someones password or private accounts that you should not be getting into. This is not to be used for malicious purposes, it is simply for educational purposes.
